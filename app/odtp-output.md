 Excellencies, distinguished delegates, High Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen.  It is my pleasure and honour to declare open this 73rd Plenary Session of the Executive Committee of the High Commissioner's Programme.  A very warm greeting to all of you and especially to those who have travelled from their respective capitals to join us this morning.  After two years of COVID-19 related travel and meeting restrictions, it is nice to see a full room and to be able to return to in-person meetings once again.  I am sure you will agree with me that it is helpful to speak face to face about UNHCR's work and the growing displacement.  As you may know, there are currently more than 100 million individuals around the world who are displaced as a result of persecution, conflict, generalised violence and human rights violations.  This is an increase of 18 million from when we last met.  To put things into perspective, it is also significantly more than double the 42.7 million who were displaced a decade ago, in 2012.  This scenario has resulted in enormous challenges for humanitarian organisations like UNHCR.  The role of the Executive Committee in helping to bring about a change in the way that human rights are being implemented in the world is a key factor.  The role of the Executive Committee in helping UNHCR address these challenges remains key in this respect.  I look forward to the thoughts you will bring to bear on this subject in our session this week.  Before we begin the formal programme, I would like to say just how privileged and honoured I have been to be able to be here.  I have been to preside over the Executive Committee of the High Commissioner's Programme during the past year.  I have had the opportunity to see close up the important work that UNHCR is doing, together with its committed partners, and that particularly during my field visit to Uganda in May.  Last May.  I was moved by the plight of the refugees with whom I met during this visit, and impressed by the progressive manner in which Uganda is managing the refugee situation.  Excellencies, distinguished delegates,  I now invite the Committee to consider the adoption of the provisional agenda as contained in Document A/AC,  and the  UNHCR's  final agenda.  We will begin this year with the High Commissioner's opening statement, under Agenda Item 2.  We will then launch the General Debate under Agenda Item 3.  Agenda Item 4 will permit us to review the results of the work carried out in the last three years,  in the areas of international protection and programme budgets, management, financial control and administrative oversight.  Under Agenda Item 5, the Committee will review reports relating to programme and administrative oversight and evaluation.  The Executive Committee will, under Agenda Item 6,  review the programme budget for 2023,  and will then consider a draft general decision on administrative, financial and programme matters,  including approval of the budget.  Under Agenda Item 7,  the Committee will be briefed on the global consultations with non-governmental organisations,  which took place in June.  Under Agenda Item 8,  UNHCR's Staff Council will make a statement to the Committee.  Agenda Item 9 concerns the programme of work of the Standing Committee in 2023,  including observer participation for the inter-sessional period of the 74th session.  Under Agenda Item 10,  the Committee will consider the draft provisional agenda,  for the 74th plenary session of the Executive Committee.  Under Agenda Item 11,  the Executive Committee will elect its officers to serve during the next inter-sessional period,  and until the end of the 74th plenary session.  Following the election,  the Chairperson-elect will be invited to make a brief statement to the Committee.  Following the election,  the Chairperson-elect will be invited to make a brief statement to the Committee.

 I see no objections. It is so decided.  I would now like to say a few words about the speaking arrangements.  The list of speakers for the General Debate Agenda Item 3 was opened on 12 September  and the list was shared with Delegations on 6 October.  Delegations have received an organisational note from the Secretariat  outlining the procedures for any amendments to the list of speakers  and are asked to follow them in order to be able to respond.  This is in order to facilitate the smooth running of our debates.  Should a State or Organisation speaking on behalf of a group of States or group of Organisations  wish to make a statement, they should inform the Secretariat  well in advance of the relevant agenda item.  Delegations are asked to limit their statements to five minutes.  In the case of a country or Organisation,  representing a group of countries or organisations will have seven minutes.  I would like to appeal to everyone to keep their statements to the allotted time,  to maintain a normal speed when making their statements,  and to provide an advance copy to the Secretariat in order to facilitate the work of our interpreters.  Finally, I would like to recall that we are here because of our common and shared desire  to help people who have been forced to flee their homes  and because of our shared humanitarian values.  With this in mind, I would like to emphasise the purely humanitarian and non-political nature  of our discussion.  I would like to thank the  Excellencies, Distinguished Delegates,  I would now like to invite you to view a short film entitled  "The Future Depends on Us".  It looks back at a year full of challenges,  one where the number of displaced people worldwide reached 100 million,  and reminds us of our power to take action and the duty  and to make a difference now so that tomorrow would be better.  This film, which was produced in collaboration with Prince Lokendo,  a Congolese refugee living in Malawi,  will set the scene for our discussions.  Could we run the movie, please?

 Every year, more and more people are forced to flee.  Violence, persecution, discrimination, and conflict.  Over 100 million people are now uprooted.  How does this figure make you feel?  Shocked? Exhausted? Indifferent? Hopeless? Angry?  Imagine having to flee in search for a place safer than your own home,  your own neighborhood, your own country.

 Some are leaving everything behind right now just to survive.  Will we give them the help they need?  Around the world, there is solidarity for people forced to flee.  Countries open borders, and people open their hearts and their homes,  even in the most challenging circumstances.  But there is so much more to be done.  The needs are now far greater than the response.  The humanitarian emergency is further complicated by the climate emergency.  One of the world's biggest threats is being ignored by many of the most powerful,  leaving the most vulnerable, including those who are displaced, to pay the price.

 I would like to thank all those responsible for putting together these moving images.  Let us keep in mind throughout the debate the children, women and men who now urgently  look to governments, UNHCR and other partners for protection, assistance and solutions.  They are counting on all of us for support.  Excellencies, distinguished delegates, before turning to item 2 of the agenda, I would like  to take the opportunity to warmly congratulate you, Mr High Commissioner, dear Filippo, on  behalf of this Committee for your recent re-election by the General Assembly and the extension  of your mandate.  Thank you.  I will not terminate until 31 December 2025.  And it now gives me great pleasure to invite the High Commissioner to address the Committee.

 Never before have we, as a human race, moved so much, so easily.  We move for work, for pleasure, for curiosity, for meeting with friends and family.  But how often do we really reflect on movement?  Do we appreciate the ease with which many of us can choose to move?  And how much do we really, really think about what movement, or rather flight, means for refugees?  How it is for them to move?  How to move in a world that too often does not want them to?  The video we just showed, as you heard, co-produced and narrated by Prince, a Congolese refugee in Malawi,  helps us visualize this.  Their fears and their aspirations.  And it highlights the importance of enabling refugee voices to be heard.  And acted upon.  Not just today, but all the time, until their plight is resolved.  Mr. Chairman, dear Salim, ministers, delegates, colleagues, friends,  Thank you for caring for the more than 100 million people, 100 million, whom we are tasked to protect,  and whose plight we must ease and spread.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And your storehouse in the historic city for which our community is committed.  Bottoms up!  You did your part in building our leader ahead of theCamera DAY era for the future;  and joining the CEurning Group for Mariupol Active V konnten crowning famous global  and global leaders of Europe.  And let me express the kindness of the for many more in this fair way that is the axis  in front of us to visit.  The Museum is your home, Бы stewêtreício.  will remember that while politics are all around us, this is a non-political forum,  and our focus should not be on scoring political points, but on finding solutions for people  like Prince and the refugees in his film.  Mr. Chairman, in such a complex world, we need to work together.  Unfortunately, the international community has become quite unable to do so,  unable to make peace or even prevent predictable catastrophes, to share vaccines,  to reduce risks from the climate emergency, to spend a little now money, political capital,  or both, to avoid much greater expense in the future.  The impact of this situation is not only on the people, but on the people of the world.  The impact of this situation is not only on the people of the world, but on the people of the world.  This inaction on the world's most vulnerable is grave.  COVID, climate conflict, and now a cost-of-living crisis are causing ever more hardship,  and indeed, and in various ways, compelling people to flee.  The demand for UNHCR's response has never been greater,  while its space to find solutions has perhaps perished.  While in many countries the COVID-19 pandemic is gradually being addressed,  its longer-term consequences continue to impact the most vulnerable,  including often refugees and displaced people.  Meanwhile, the climate emergency increasingly drives displacement,  making life harder also for those already uprooted.  The link between the two is a long-term problem.  The link between the two is a long-term problem.  The link between the two is a long-term problem.  The link between climate change and displacement is clear and growing.  The link between climate change and displacement is clear and growing.  We see it in the Horn of Africa, for example,  where people are forced to flee by a combination of conflict and drought.  More than one million have been displaced in Somalia alone since January 2021.  Around 80% of refugees are from countries that are most affected by the climate emergency.  Around 80% of refugees are from countries that are most affected by the climate emergency.  Some 90% of recent returnees have gone back to highly climate vulnerable situations.  But what is their future?  And what is the future of those hoping to return home?  Of those, displaced or not, like I saw in Cameroon, who see their lives and livelihoods  evaporate like the lakes that have nourished their families for generations.  Refugees and displaced people have an enormous stake in ensuring that bold climate action  is taken, but they are too often forgotten in this discussion.  UNHCR, as you know, has continued to step up its climate response, strengthening legal  and normative guidance to states, responding to climate-induced displacement, building  resilience to climate shocks, and building resilience to climate change.  This is the아니 effigy of our commitment to a Horizon Target Flag and indicates the  Government's commitment to improving functioning andffee of sustainable energy in towwo  d activity and Voilà!  Ideological solutions to climate change.  1.  Billions of $30 billion are invested in programs to handle climate change rehabilitation issues,  developing infrastructure,олжomo wende over cruise ships, but nearly dez processes grass-fed  agentures, natural resources for water and sewage risk reduction.  As of April 2017, billionazke is acquired.  2.  2.  access climate finance, including from the US$100 billion annual commitment for climate  action, so that, among other measures, they can prevent displacement, adapt and prepare.  In turn, adaptation and preparedness plans must include the displaced, actual and potential.  And please ensure that their plight is taken into consideration in Sharm el-Sheikh next  month.  Global inflationary pressures are also having a severe effect on the most vulnerable.  Poverty and food insecurity are rising.  The World Food Program is forced to cut assistance.  And some – refugees and often their hosts – are taking desperate measures because  they  can no longer make ends meet.  Just last month, a boat with Lebanese people on board, along with Syrian and Palestinian  refugees capsized after departing Lebanon.  More than 100 drowned in the Mediterranean, adding themselves to the estimated 1,630 others  who have lost their lives this year alone trying to reach Europe, not to mention those  who have died along other routes.  Desperate living conditions often combine with conflict, violence and discrimination  in a toxic mix that leaves people with little hope for a future.  While UNHCR is obviously unable to influence global macroeconomic trends, we are doing  what we can to alleviate hardship and provide opportunities.  We are engaging with international monetary finance.  We are encouraging the international monetary finance commission to provide financial assistance  to the United States.  I am sure that UNHCR will be a successful partner.  Fund, for example, so they consider forced displacement as a relevant factor in planning  their support to States, especially where the percentage of refugees and their economic  impact, both positive and negative, is significant.  You have heard me speak many times about the progress we have made with the World Bank,  bilateral donors, regional banks, and other financial institutions in providing support  to refugee-hosting countries that are including refugees in their national plans.  The OECD estimates about $3.3 billion of bilateral development funds are injected into refugee  situations every year.  This is in addition to around $2 billion per year  of capital from the World Bank.  The OECD estimates that the most important contribution from the World Bank is the  international support for refugees, especially in the form of grants to bolster and support  host countries and communities that are shouldering a disproportionate amount of the international  community's responsibility for refugees.  The OECD estimates that the most important contribution from the World Bank is the expansion  of international support for refugees, especially in the form of grants to bolster and support  gelion and Jestler connections, including Community Health questions, and that from  Peter Rak쉬an , who has bestowed a  generous lecture on our partners, оз vara  Let's break it down.  remains the biggest driver of force displacement.  Like in Myanmar, where an estimated one million people  have been uprooted within the country since the military takeover last February.  Or Burkina Faso, where 325,000 people have fled their homes this year alone,  one of many deeply worrying indicators reflecting the instability in the Sahel,  which is displacing people not only within their countries but beyond,  including to coastal states, North Africa and Europe.  Despite UNHCR's stretched capacity, we have responded to each of the 37 emergencies  declared in the past 12 months, whether caused by conflict, climate,  or frequently a combination of both, as for example in Mozambique,  where the number of people who have fled their homes has increased by more than  1,000, or in the region of Tbilisi, where 125,000 people have been freshly displaced.  But the Russian invasion of Ukraine has taken emergency response to new levels,  as it precipitated the largest and fastest displacement crisis in Europe since the Second World War,  as many of us witnessed firsthand at the borders of Ukraine's neighbors  in the weeks following 24 February.  Displacement continues, and nearly eight months later,  lives and civilian infrastructure are being inexcusably destroyed.  Today, Mr. Chairman, is another day of anguish for the Ukrainian people.  As we speak, my colleagues are reporting to me horrifying strikes of the Ukrainian army,  which have been reported to be taking place in the city of Kiev, Dnipro, Lviv, Zaporizhia,  Chernihiv, Odessa, and elsewhere.  UNHCR is active wherever Ukrainians have been displaced.  EU member states and other states in Europe must be commended for their exceptional leadership  and cooperation in addressing the refugee crisis.  We have also been engaged in countries around the world,  such as in the Russian Federation.  We have developed innovative responses,  for example in some European countries,  and in partnership with UNICEF and local authorities,  through the extensive network of Blue Dot Protection Hubs,  where refugees can seek help from staff and volunteers  who identify specific needs,  like for separated children,  women at risk, including from gender-based violence,  and those with trauma.  We have worked with IOM, UNODC, NGO partners,  and authorities to counter trafficking  by offering information, resources, and transportation.  And we have provided cash assistance to vulnerable refugees.  Cash has given them agency and choice.  It is often the lifeline needed to rent an apartment,  reach family or friends,  or have some resources in hand to reject the advances of those with criminal intentions.  This is why cash assistance is not charity but protection,  and not just for Ukrainians, but around the world.  The situation inside Ukraine remains grave.  At least 6.2 million people are internally displaced  and many more need humanitarian support.  I wish to praise the able leadership of the Ukrainian government  in the humanitarian response.  Our contribution, in agreement with the authorities  and within the UN-coordinated operation,  has focused on three pillars:  protection, shelter, and cash assistance.  But I share the government's concerns about the looming winter.  We will continue to work hard,  but we must be realistic in our expectations.  This requires an all-hands-on-deck approach.  And I appeal to those with expertise and resources  to redouble effort in support of the government's winterization plans.  Millions of Ukrainians, especially the aged and disabled,  are counting on all of us.  Mr. Chairman,  the response to the outflow of people from Ukraine  has been nothing short of extraordinary.  Moldovan generosity, for example,  has been exemplary in spite of Moldova's big challenges.  Almost half of the contributions to our appeal  have come from private individuals and companies.  The application of the Temporary Protection Directive  within the European Union  enabled millions of Ukrainians to find safety immediately  and go where they had support networks  without putting pressure on asylum systems.  And yes, while neighbors may be easier to receive and integrate,  the Ukrainian crisis debunked so many myths  that we have heard over the years from some politicians.  Europe is full.  Public opinion is against taking in more refugees.  Relocation is impossible.  Surely, last year,  Europe was seemingly unable to deal with a few dozen people  being disembarked from a boat.  But suddenly, seven million were received with dignity  and protected appropriately.  Temporary protection proved to be not only a humanitarian threat,  but a very effective tool to receive and include refugees.  Four million have now registered.  The way that European governments and the European people responded  proved right what this year's Nansen Award recipient,  former German Chancellor Angela Merkel,  said all those years ago:  "Wir schaffen das."  We can do it.  Of course, I am not saying that everyone has a right to go wherever they wish.  Many flows today are complex,  and an approach like temporary protection cannot be applied  to every person, everywhere.  I fully acknowledge also that some receiving states  have big challenges handling the demands.  Numbers can be large.  Asylum systems lack resources.  And years of the process,  and years of the public being told that things are chaotic  and at times indeed disorganized responses,  have undermined public trust and confidence  in the management of asylum.  But not the concept or its importance.  UNHR is ready to support states in rebuilding that confidence  with fair and fast asylum processes  that enable both protection  for those who need,  and returns,  with dignity and rights respected,  of those who do not.  We are reflecting and consulting,  and we will reach out to states  with new ideas that can ensure  access to territory,  international protection,  adherence to refugee and human rights law,  while finding practical ways  to address the complexity of contemporary flows.  But we must equally and forcefully reject  simplistic slogans by some politicians  to respond to these challenges  by building walls,  either physical or procedural.  We must not accept the denial of access to territory  for those seeking asylum,  often through violent pushbacks.  We must not normalize attempts  to outsource asylum responsibilities.  Legally, morally, and practically,  I oppose efforts to evade a state's responsibility  by externalizing its asylum obligations.  And I hope that those thinking of those approaches  will reconsider carefully.  I also reject what we have heard  some politicians on this continent  tell their voters:  that Ukrainians are real refugees,  while others fleeing similar horrors  but from different parts of the world are not.  There is only one word to define this attitude:  racist.  It is also insulting to the many host countries  around the world that have for years,  decades or generations,  provided protection and support to millions,  in order to live up to their responsibilities  and their obligations,  and to uphold the basic and fundamental morality  that cuts across cultures.  Mr. Chairman,  as we all know,  the armed conflict in Ukraine  which followed the Russian invasion  is having global ramifications,  especially on those without the resources  to cushion the blow.  It is also having consequences  on contributions to UNHCR.  On the one hand,  I must say that,  like for Afghanistan last year,  I am buoyed by the outpouring of support  we have received from the general public,  private companies and foundations.  In 2019,  we raised 421 million US dollars  from private sources,  increasing to 538 million in 2019.  In 2020,  we raised 625 million US dollars from private donors.  This year,  we will exceed 1 billion US dollars  from private donors.  Private companies have also,  in the context of the Global Compact on Refugees,  brought about innovation,  sorry,  brought their innovation,  know-how and expertise  to support not just our operations,  but also their own,  as they hire refugees.  This is truly heartwarming.  We have reached out to new donors,  including in the area of Islamic philanthropy.  Building on the success  of our Zakat and Sadaka campaigns,  I signed an agreement two weeks ago  with the Islamic Solidarity Fund for Development  and the Islamic Development Bank  to launch the first global Islamic fund for development.  We send fatto will  increasing CDI funding  to encourage veteran refugees  to apply for the European Retirement Fund.  Starting from next year,  the fund,  which holds Sharia compliant investments,  will begin generating money  to support UNHCR operations.  Yes,  yet despite these  and other positive developments  I regret  to inform you  that for the first time during my tenure,  I'm worried  about UNHCRs financial situation.  base, which we have, vastly exceeding targets on private contributions.  But as a United Nations agency, one created by member states with a specific mandate,  we cannot be reliant on the goodwill of individuals or companies alone.  While, of course, most welcome in an area in which we will continue to invest, private  contributions do not have the same predictability as those of states and are not, nor cannot  be, the bedrock upon which we function.  We therefore look to you, states, for support.  The response by traditional donors this year has remained extremely strong and is led once  again and by far by the exceptional levels of financing from the United States of America,  followed by Germany.  Germany, whose support in all aspects has remained steadfast.  But the Ukraine emergency has added over $1 billion to our budget this year, bringing  it to a total of $10.7 billion.  And while the Ukraine response has been and must continue to be well-funded, this has  to be the target for all operations.  Funding for  new emergencies like Ukraine needs to be in addition to, not instead of, the others.  I appreciate the very real pressure on donor budgets, the hardship that is confronting  citizens and taxpayers, and I acknowledge that most have made their overall Ukraine-related  contributions additional.  But I must report that, with the exception of a handful of donors,  additionality is not always visible when it comes to specific contributions to UNHCR.  I therefore appeal in the strongest of terms to all donors to please do more to support  UNHCR and refugees around the world.  If we do not receive at least an additional $700 million U.S. dollars, especially for  our most underfunded operations, between now and the end of this year, we will be in a  dire situation.  We will be forced to make severe cuts with negative and sometimes dramatic consequences  for refugees and host communities.  And I must also remind donors of the importance of multi-year and un-year mark funding, and  thank Sweden and Norway for continuing to lead in this regard.  Just 12% of UNHCR's government income is un-year marked.  Now it will pass to fikeroque, where the schools will offer tuition at school.  The cure must be checked throughout all theaters, and schools are a prime Guard of the country.  2 means:  "This good and interesting new students need ofimportant school systems to deal with crisis  and loneliness."  2:  And 3,  gain  hope,  writers,  neighboring Pakistan and Iran.  Our operations in Ethiopia were in focus before Afghanistan and are now just 46% funded, although  after the resumption of hostilities in September, humanitarian conditions are deteriorating  again.  Support was strong in the years following the initial displacement of Rohingya refugees.  Last year's joint response plan was 72% funded.  It stands at just 30%, with dramatic cuts to programming on the horizon from all UN  agencies and NGOs operating in Bangladesh unless donors provide urgently more help.  Uganda hosts over 1.5 million refugees and has  very  generous refugee policies.  Yet our operation there faces a huge financial gap, and we struggle to help the 110,000 Congolese  and South Sudanese refugees who have arrived this year alone.  In the Sahel, people have been subjected to extreme violence as well as the climate emergency.  Yet the funding shortfall is preventing us from  providing the necessary support for the refugees.  The Sahel is a place of great interest to us.  We are committed to helping the refugees.  We are committed to helping the refugees.  We are committed to helping the refugees.  We are committed to helping the refugees.  From thisatur Aliceil, Rohingya refugee also said:  But they can do anything by helping their families, children, families, and families.  Take the sites and donate, e-mails, and no專il banners or banners from GoT and the  government, that you can also do it, If you will.  concretely take state-run governments like the GQ, acidic earth and ouraty joint enthusiastic ώ  the obstacles to return, especially those frequently mentioned by refugees. We will  continue to discuss with the government how to strengthen humanitarian access to those in need,  including displaced and returnees. However, our work is poorly funded, limiting the humanitarian  and early recovery response which we conduct in Syria also in the framework of Security Council  Resolution 2642. At the same time, funding to the refugee response in neighboring countries  is at its lowest level ever. The situation is further worsened by the fact that host communities  are also suffering the effects of the economic downturn, especially in Lebanon. And let us not  forget that Lebanon and Jordan host the highest percentage of refugees per capita,  and that is a significant number. We are also working to strengthen the humanitarian and early  recovery response in Syria, and Turkey remains the largest host country in the world.  This situation is untenable, and we must ensure both adequate funding in host countries and the  renewed focus on resolving more than 11 years of Syrian displacement. This, Mr. Chairman, is a plea  to all: donors, hosts, countries of origin, international organizations, development partners,  and each of us as global citizens. If we do not maintain focus on all crises and adequately  resource all responses, we are dooming refugees and their hosts to further hardship, loss of hope,  and the risk of onward movement. This effort must also include searching for solutions,  no matter how difficult they might be. In some places, this may mean  in supporting countries of origin, as well as refugees who choose, voluntarily, to return,  even to difficult, imperfect conditions.  Do not get me wrong.  I will never, never advocate or acquiesce to inducing or pushing refugees back.  But the reality is that, regardless of what we say, some refugees do return to conditions  that are less than or even far from ideal.  It is therefore incumbent upon us not to be paralyzed by politics, but to help people  restart their lives if, and I repeat, if they make the choice to return.  Countries of origin have the biggest responsibility in creating conditions for safe return.  But it also takes all of us to work together.  And when we do,  it can happen.  I spent World Refugee Day this year in Côte d'Ivoire, a country that emerged from years  of civil strife during which hundreds of thousands of its citizens fled into exile.  It was not easy, of course.  Reconciliation never is.  But Ivorian leaders worked for peace with international support.  And as a result, the countries of the region that had protected  and helped refugees for years declared, upon our recommendation, the Cessation Clause for  Ivorian refugees.  Some 96% of the refugees have now returned home, and Ivorians that have chosen to stay  abroad are being regularized by host countries.  Côte d'Ivoire is perhaps the best, but not the only example.  And we cooperate with countries of asylum and asylum seekers, and we work with them to make  the most of the situation.  And we are working with them to make the most of the situation.  For example, we continue to work on the solution strategy for Sudan four South Sudan — despite  challenges.  More than 600,000 people have returned to South Sudan in recent years.  I also see, following my visit to Tanzania, potential for solutions for Burundian refugees  there — subject to more support inside Burundians.  Let me discuss the following.

Burundi, although I must express grave concern for the violent and fragile situation in the  sub-region, including the displacement of 150,000 people within and from the Democratic  Republic of the Congo this year, in a context of unimaginable violence, especially against  women.  My thanks also go to countries that have hosted and regularized Venezuelan refugees and my  migrants.  Colombia led by establishing an effective temporary protection system.  Regularization operations there and now elsewhere, such as in Ecuador, are progressing fast.  At the same time, we look forward to renewed dialogue with Venezuela to address the underlying  causes of movements from that country.  In the Americas, we can also draw lessons from the recent developments in the region.  We have a strong relationship with the Venezuelan people, and we are committed to working with  them.  We must also draw lessons from the regional approach taken by the MIPS support platform,  with a stronger focus on solutions.  Work in the region will be hopefully buoyed by the Los Angeles Declaration, another important  step to consolidate protection and the quest for solutions throughout the hemisphere.  And we must step up work to seek solutions for internally displaced people, building  on the report of the High-Leveled People's Union.  I am very grateful to the UN for the opportunity to speak with you today.  I am very grateful to the UN for the opportunity to speak with you today.

Turkmenistan, Albania, and the Netherlands  established statelessness determination procedures.  While 81,000 formerly stateless people were granted  nationality in 2021, we're still far from eradicating  this deprivation of rights.  I appeal to all states to adopt the necessary laws, policies,  and practices to help bring millions more out  of the shadows of statelessness before the end of the I  Belong campaign in 2024.  And talking of solutions, we must not  forget the importance of building  the capacity of individuals.  One of the best ways is through education.

The progress we have made must be sustained despite the many pressing challenges.  And third countries' solutions for refugees are also critical.  I am heartened by the return of the United States to the top of the table for resettlement  places.  And thank Canada and Sweden for also leading the way.  I am grateful to Norway and Finland for receiving emergency resettlement cases.  This gesture has saved many, many lives.  I am pleased that the global figure of resettled refugees has increased with 76,500 submissions  already this year and counting.  I encourage all countries with means to expand resettlement and appeal that they do so separately  and in addition to other programs such as relocation or humanitarian evacuations.  Further opportunities for complementary pathways such as done in Canada and family reunification  where Germany shows the way are also important.  Mr. Chairman, UNHCR is well aware of the need to continuously improve its effectiveness,  efficiency and fairness.  In 2016, we launched a transformation process which has not only seen regionalization and  decentralization of the region.  Navigating from instability to a depressed country from Turkey and other countries and 票-س Kejler Or Multiparty Council personnel  We haveid some delays,   Nonparallel Buildings  and Groove-in  누  re  incurred  We produkf  n iamo  interoperable in the cloud. We have overhauled and simplified our partnership management processes,  1.4 billion US dollars worth of our annual expenditure. This will have many advantages,  for example expanding partnerships with national NGOs and refugee-led organizations that do not  have the capacity to represent authoritative and heavy proposals for reporting requirements.  So that, together, we spend time and resources not on paperwork, but rather on delivering the best  possible programs to refugees. COMPASS, our new results-based monitoring system, has enabled  multiyear strategies, meaning that we can better sequence and plan over the medium and long-term  in order to achieve-  achieve lasting and transformative results.  And one more example: our innovative fleet management system, developed with the World  Food Programme and now available to all agencies, is leading the UN system in saving money,  miles and reducing our collective carbon footprint.  We have also reported to you in previous meetings our work to eradicate sexual exploitation  and abuse and sexual harassment.  This remains a priority for senior management and me personally, as does achieving gender  parity and geographic and racial diversity throughout the organization.  We have also continued to strengthen risk management, investigation capacity and oversight,  while at the same time implementing an alternative dispute resolution mechanism for issues that  fall more in the realm of management rather than misconduct.  All of these reforms are important, but are not yet complete.  The need to bring them to reasonable outcomes after the slowdown caused by COVID-19 and  the fact that humanitarian and refugee emergencies continue to grow led, as you heard from the  Chairman, the Secretary-General to propose a new policy.  The new policy is to ensure that the United States and the United States of America are  not in conflict with each other.  This is between U.S. leaders and civil society elites trying to force destabilizing,  anti-terrorist bias by putting us on the edge for довольно long time.  Our policy is based on the principles set forth by the United States, Israel and Egypt.  Our strength is in broading the framework of our initiative, suggesting we can bring  productivity, chain Corporation workers and refugees to a higher level of security and  well-being in the virtual world, as we guide them through the U.S. climate change campaign.  I urge all BETA levels of credit and aid to implement the platforms that вполне welcome  UNHCR is not just relevant but effective, and that my colleagues are committed and caring,  and no matter the challenge they deliver for those we serve, alongside their state and  civil society partners.  Colleagues and partners whom I would like here to thank most sincerely.  Mr. Chairman, it has been nearly four years since Member States affirmed the Global Compact  on Refugees.  Much as I have outlined above has been achieved since then.  We have enhanced responses, established support platforms, mainstream cooperation with development  actors around the world.  We have truly brought about in many situations a whole-of-society response that includes  citizens, companies, academics, the sports community, and the public.  The Global Compact on Refugees is a great opportunity to bring together all of us,  the world community, religious actors, and others in the service of refugees and their  hosts.  We had a successful Global Refugee Forum in 2019, but we still have a long way to go.  In a little bit more than one year, we will have our second Forum.  I am thankful that Switzerland will again graciously co-host the event.  And I am pleased to announce that Colombia, France, Japan, Jordan, Niger, and Uganda will  co-convene the meeting alongside UNHCR.  I thank the outgoing co-conveners Costa Rica, Ethiopia, Germany, Pakistan, and Turkey also  for the follow-up on pledge implementation.  We have 14 months until that event.  We have 14 months to make progress, to make good on the pledges of the last Forum and  prepare the ground for more pledges at the next.  And the redoubling of that action, that drive and determination to help, to assist, and  mostly to resolve, must be done together, as united nations.  And that must start today.

Excellencies, distinguished delegates, I now propose to launch the general debate.  In addition to having heard from the High Commissioner, delegations have received from  UNHCR updates on regional developments and on global programmes, which will inform, hopefully,  our discussions.  I would like to reiterate that our discussions are supposed to be purely humanitarian and  non-political in nature.  I also thank the High Commissioner for his statement.  I would also remind delegations to limit their statements to five minutes in the case of  a country, or seven minutes in case of organisations representing a group of countries or group  of organisations.  And I, like it is customary, I will be giving the floor to the High Commissioner to respond  and to comment.

 Thank you very much, Mr. President, Mr. High Commissioner, Excellencies, distinguished colleagues.  I make this statement in the name of the African Group.  Mr. President, the African Group wants to express its sincere gratitude to the President that you are,  as well as to the members of the Office, and congratulates you for your leadership,  as well as for the brilliant work of the Executive Committee of the HCR.  The African Group also thanks the High Commissioner for his commitment and his dynamism,  I was going to say his activism for the cause of refugees and displaced persons.  Mr. President, the high trend of forced movements in the world in general  and on the African continent in particular,  caused by persecutions, armed conflicts, violence, human rights violations, terrorism,  the effects of climate change and natural disasters is extremely worrying.  The African Group expresses its most vivid concerns about the latest figure of the HCR,  estimating more than 100 million displaced persons by force  across the world.  However, the number of displaced persons was estimated at 89.3 million at the end of 2021.  Forced movements continue to represent a formidable challenge for the African continent.  Africa has seen its development gains compromised by prolonged displacement situations and by  the most complex new humanitarian emergencies.  These displacement situations have increased the number of displaced persons in Africa,  and the number of displaced persons in Africa has increased by more than 1 million.  The African Group has also been working to improve the development of the African continent.  We have seen that demand for humanitarian support has 320,000 households and at an  at an annual basis jego  271,500 Yeas.  hosts 100,000 refugees.  This has been a huge esteem among the African and African diverse community and organizations,  and it's important to continue to get better and better at the education and training up  that must engage each citizen in the FREE的人 whom is threatening and oppressing our  humanity as human society.  Finding an inclusive and reactive and broadband  In this sense, the African Group is rejoicing in the various initiatives taken by intergovernmental organizations and the private sector  in order to develop adequate solutions to meet the needs of displaced people.  Aware that solutions to the situation of prolonged displacement and complex humanitarian emergencies  could only be found through political will, cooperation and solid multilateral partnerships  in accordance with the World Refugee Pact, the African Group is rejoicing in the various initiatives taken at the national, bilateral and regional level  to tackle the deep causes of forced displacement in our continent.  The recommendations, as relevant as appropriate,  are formulated in the context of the European Union and the European Union,  which, after the extraordinary humanitarian summit held in Malabo in May 2022,  witnessed the willingness and determination of the political party to tackle the deep causes of forced displacement  and find solutions to the problem.  Mr. President,  International cooperation is strengthened and multi-party engagement to find solutions to forced displacement  The World Refugee Pact is a solid framework for more predictable and equitable sharing of responsibility and responsibility.  This is why the African group is pleased with the progress made in the framework of the World Pact,  particularly the increase of public aid for developing countries,  partnerships aimed at implementing political measures to reduce poverty and create sustainable solutions.  While encouraging members of the international community to continue to increase their responsibilities  in the field of sharing of responsibility and responsibility according to the commitments taken at the World Refugee Forum,  the African group is pleased with the progress made in the framework of the World Pact.  On the subject of food and public transport, our African member calls for an effective implementation  of the call for action by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, our Common Programme,  which will enable the promotion and performance of the rights of migrants, refugees, asylum seekers and people with disabilities.  Mr President, the number of people displaced from their own countries because of conflict, violence,  and climate change has not ceased to increase to reach a record level at the end of 2021.  The increasing increase in internal travel around the world, estimated at 59.1 million in 2021,  compared to 55 million the previous year, is extremely worrying. Africa is in a  unprecedented situation in terms of human travel within its own country.  These travel have come to add to those caused by climate disasters in  several regions of the continent. It should be noted that about 4.3 million people are  newly displaced due to disasters mainly linked to climate change.  However, the African group rejoices in the engagement of the HCR to the global response  to internal travel in cooperation with the States and in  support of national actions with banks for regional multilateral development to ensure  that internal travel situations are taken into account in the development of their  policies and programs. The African group also congratulates itself on the help provided to the government  by the organization in the framework of the elaboration of appropriate legal and political  framework for the protection of displaced people in the context of disasters.  The African group also encourages the United Nations to take steps to address the  challenges of the global climate crisis and climate change, while calling on the international community  to double its efforts to share responsibilities and find sustainable solutions that can reverse  the current trend and considerably reduce the level of internal travel in our continent.  The African group encourages the leading parties to implement effective commitments contained  in the United Nations Secretary General's Action Program on Internal Travel and the Development of the World.  The African group has also encouraged the United Nations to make response Η de溏  s ritual to the Christmas dinner ceremony and to the effective implementation of the Group's  recommendations of the high level experience in the question of internal travel.  The African group announcement is quite long. The president, I would courage myself to send a  more comprehensive version. Heít'слme seulement dê le conclutant intéressé  à l'action du groupe africain, je voudrais simplement termine en disantér le groupe africain réitère son soutien  continué à la ASIA, et affirme son engagement au multilatéralisme et une coopération international accru à la USB, et au multilateralisme, a ribage incoblinée et un accruation répétable à l'ung ça à se faireوس.  and exhorts to increase the involvement of actors in development in the situation of displacement  by promoting solid, reliable and complementary partnerships with multilateral development banks and bilateral actors.  This concludes my statement. Thank you, Mr. President.

 Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I am speaking on behalf of the European Union and its member states.  The candidate countries North Macedonia, Montenegro, Ukraine and Republic of Moldova, the potential  candidate countries Bosnia and Herzegovina and Georgia, align themselves with this declaration.  Since our last meeting a year ago, forced displacement has reached yet another sad record  level with over 100 million forcibly displaced persons across the world.  The EU and its member states are deeply concerned that the pace of displacement continues to  considerably outpace solutions for both refugees and internally displaced persons.  With the challenging times we are now experiencing, we are very pleased that you, Mr. Filippo  Grandi, will continue to lead UNHCR for another two and a half years.  We commend your personal commitment and dedication to the refugee cause and reassure you of our  continued support in these efforts.  We reiterate our gratitude to the European Union and its member states for their support  of the EU and its member states.  We also extend our gratitude to governments and host communities who have taken in forcibly  displaced persons.  Most refugees worldwide seek safety in neighboring countries or within the region of their home  country, often receiving enormous solidarity from countries and communities who are experiencing  many challenges themselves.  This year, Russia's unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine has triggered the worst  displacement crisis in Europe since the Second World War.  Six million people are currently internally displaced in Ukraine and millions more have  fled the country.  We are proud of the response and strong support by European countries and communities to help  those fleeing Russia's war in Ukraine.  Due to the rapid and large-scale displacement, the EU and its member states reacted immediately  by activating for the first time the Temporary Protection Directive.  So far, around 4 million people have registered for temporary protection in EU member states.  This gives them access to essential services and access to the EU's security and security  system.  We also provide special attention to essential services, the labor market, suitable accommodation,  social welfare assistance, medical care and education.  We dedicate special attention to the protection of children and women, as well as to prevention  of human trafficking, given the high level of vulnerability of those fleeing the war.  The EU and its member states are working closely with UNHCR and other international partners  in this respect.  The EU and its member states condemn in the strongest possible terms what Russia has done  to the EU.  The EU and its member states are acting on the international grounds, including its own  and international rules-based order.  The EU has also said that the EU is the only country that has the power to remain resistant  to the EU's attack.  The EU has also said that the EU and its member states are in a position to prevent Ukraine  from taking a stand against Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, as well as the  illegal annexations by Russia of Ukrainian regions in the East, all in blatant violation  of international law, including the UN Charter, and the core principles on which the international  rules-based order is built.  By willfully undermining the rules-based international order and blatantly violating the fundamental  rights of Ukraine to independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, Russia is putting  global security at risk.  So it is very important that the EU and its member states are taking the necessary steps  to protect the international order.  member states are deeply concerned over the global impact of Russia's war, particularly  on already fragile countries, including those hosting a significant number of refugees and  other persons of concern. The EU and its member states have quickly mobilized and remained  fully engaged to address and mitigate the global consequences of the war. In May, we  committed to work with all global partners on an EU global food security response. As  part of this commitment, the EU has identified an overall contribution of over €5 billion  in humanitarian and development assistance for global food security. This includes over  €2 billion to countries in sub-Saharan Africa and another €1 billion for North Africa  and the Middle East. Another €960 million are foreseen for Latin America and the Caribbean  and Asia until 2024. Overall, almost 20% of the EU's annual humanitarian  aid is for the United States.  The EU's annual aid budget is dedicated to emergency food assistance and nutrition.  Rest assured that we have not lost sight of humanitarian needs around the world, including  in protracted displacement crises. The EU and its member states are committed to do  their part to contribute to greater burden and responsibility-sharing for refugees globally,  as well as addressing the root causes of forced displacement. Together with its member states,  the EU continues to be a leading donor to support responses to major refugee crises.  The EU has been committed to supporting the EU in its efforts to address the global refugee  crisis, bringing together humanitarian and development efforts in line with the EU policy  on forced displacement. The EU's right to seek and access asylum and the principle  of non-refoulement remain at the heart of European law, policy and action. Last year,  over 500,000 asylum seekers applied for international protection in the EU. Together with its member  states, the EU remains committed to support responses to major refugee crises around the  world and continues to be a leading donor to the EU's international efforts to address  the global refugee crisis. The EU has been committed to supporting the EU's efforts to address the  global refugee crisis and its member states, bringing together humanitarian and development  efforts in line with the EU policy on forced displacement.  We also remain committed to providing safe and legal pathways to protection in the EU.  Since 2015, EU-supported resettlement programs have been in place and have helped more than  100,000 refugees fight shelter in the EU. Access to healthcare for forcibly displaced  and stateless persons remains a significant challenge in many parts of the world, and  especially when it comes to mental health care.  The EU and its member states therefore believe that it is very relevant  that this year's Executive Committee conclusions focus on mental health and psychosocial support.  We express our appreciation for the excellent work of the rapporteur  and welcome the adoption of these conclusions by consensus at the end of our meeting this week.  The first Global Refugee Forum in Geneva three years ago  was an important milestone in bringing together a wide group of stakeholders  dedicated to the refugee cause, including more proactive engagements  with development actors and international financial institutions.  To meet the growing challenges of forced displacement,  this new form of partnerships is necessary.  We therefore welcome that this year's High Commissioner's Dialogue on Protection  is dedicated to the topic of development cooperation  and look forward to contributing with our experiences  as donors and refugee holders.  We also welcome the  role of the UNHCR in supporting countries to generate important new recommendations,  concrete policy suggestions and best practices in this area,  including how to further strengthen the humanitarian development peace nexus.  The High Commissioner's Dialogue this year will also be an important step  toward the next Global Refugee Forum in 2023,  which will be a key pillar of the UNHCR's process for the development of the refugee cause.  The UNHCR's role in this is to strengthen the global value of the UNHCR,  to make the UNHCR's pledges process efficient, simple and transparent,  building on the work and progress made in the past years  and ultimately to strengthen global solidarity and burden and responsibility sharing.  We support the participation of refugees and refugee-lead organisations in such global events.  Considering the global challenges to respond and meet the needs of forcibly displaced populations,  we appreciate that UNHCR has continued to carry on with its internal reform efforts,  especially the business transformation policy.  We commend its efforts to strengthen strategic planning, integrity and oversight functions, risk management and programming based on results.  We encourage UNHCR to strongly continue these efforts and provide regular updates on progress as well as challenges.  We welcome and share UNHCR's commitment to combating racism, intolerance and discrimination, as well as sexual and gender-based violence against displaced and stateless populations.  With a view to rapidly growing humanitarian needs, we also acknowledge UNHCR's work to broaden its donor base and encourage further efforts to this end.  Mr. Chair, let me conclude by again expressing our appreciation for the important work carried out by UNHCR and its staff in the current challenging circumstances as forced displacement continues to rise.  The EU and its Member States remain strong supporters of your work and mandate, politically as well as financially, and you can continue to count on our solid partnership.  Thank you.

The extended crises in the Arab region and its neighboring regions have caused more than 17 million people to enter the region within the United States of America,  which leads to the Arab countries' tolerance of refugees for huge responsibilities that are heavily influenced by economic, social and political effects.

This is a negative reflection of the Commission's ability to protect refugees and refugees in those countries and provide them with essential services.  It also affects the ability of their communities to provide them with stability.  Despite this, the regional countries continued to meet and integrate refugees in the national plans to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic,  provide them with services and health care, and implement measures to ensure that children from refugees to education are safe,  register them and update their proof of residence documents,  including the official documents of the Commission.  The regional countries continued to provide assistance and protection to women and girls from refugees,  and continued to provide employment opportunities and support for business leadership in cooperation with the Commission and the donor countries.  At the same time, the regional countries continued to provide voluntary assistance,  and the assistance of civil society organizations and the Arab charity organizations and the individuals who donate.  The regional countries are now supporting the group  in the role of all the donor countries and the donor organizations,  as well as the role of the private sector in supporting the budget of the Commission.  This confirms that the donor Arab countries will not and will not stop supporting the Commission's efforts,  faithfully, in the importance of strengthening the joint national work.  The group, the international community, is also encouraging the need to increase the amount of funding for the Commission programs and activities,  and increasing the amount of non-private contributions in response to the Commission's calls in this regard.  In this context, the group is recovering from the anxiety of the global humanitarian situation,  caused by the new humanitarian crises as a result of geopolitical crises,  and it is intensifying the need for response to the rapid and extended humanitarian crises in a fair and balanced way,  and it is also encouraging the group to continue to support the Commission's programs and activities,  and to provide the funding it needs.  The group also confirms the importance of maintaining the human labor nature of the Commission,  and to ensure that the future of the division of different concepts may have a negative impact on its activities.  The group also confirms the importance of providing comprehensive health care for refugees,  and to facilitate the promotion and increase of financial and artistic support in the field of health care for refugees.

He also points out that the 2023 budget report includes a reduction in the rate of the special funding for the refugee and eviction crisis in the Middle East and North Africa,  and the absence of an increase in the rate of the special funding for the resettlement of the refugee and eviction crisis in the Middle East and North Africa.

 I am honored to carry out this intervention on behalf of the Grup LAC  to express our recognition of the leadership demonstrated by the ACNUR  during this period in which we continue to face important challenges  and in which our capacity to respond to common challenges has been transformed.  The Grup LAC transfers to the High Commissioner, Filippo Grandi,  his most cordial congratulations for extending his mandate.  This is a crucial moment to continue strengthening the joint work with the ACNUR  in favor of refugees and receiving communities.  The Grup LAC is convinced that solidarity and respect for human rights  are cornerstones of collective efforts to achieve the protection of people  who have been forced to leave their communities  and who are not a burden but a responsibility.  According to the ACNUR data,  the number of displaced people forced into a world  continues to increase.  Violence, wars, hunger and devastating effects of climate change  are behind this massive movement of people, which already exceeds 100 million.  Certainly, Latin America and the Caribbean  are one of the regions most affected by this situation,  and this year in particular,  we are facing an increase in the number of people  who, by exposing themselves to danger,  have created other migratory routes in the region.  The Grup LAC is convinced that these growing challenges  can only be faced with coordination and harmonization  between the universal regional protection systems  and national efforts.  For this reason, we highlight the importance of dialogue,  sustainable international cooperation  and shared responsibility  to find solutions that allow us to continue offering assistance and support  in the region and, at the same time,  to advance towards the achievement of lasting solutions.  Despite the speed and magnitude of forced displacement,  the solutions available continue to be overcome,  such as voluntary return, resettlement, complementary routes  and local integration for displaced people,  which are also a source of hope for the people of Latin America.  In 2021, the return of volunteers from the refugee and displaced  and internal communities increased,  returning to levels prior to COVID-19.  In addition, voluntary repatriation increased by 71%.  The Latin American and Caribbean regions are distinguished  by their historic solidarity and openness to the people  who need and have the necessary assistance and support.  This humanitarian vocation is reflected in the existing cooperation  and the articulation of regional and sub-regional mechanisms,  which facilitate dialogue and coordination  under a shared responsibility approach.  Efforts to regulate, provide protection and integrate these people locally  are examples of the good practices that have been implemented  in the region and in the region-to-region.  Thank you.  I would like to extend my thanks to the UN for the support  of the UN and the UNRWA for its work in the region  and for its support of the international community.  In addition, the UNRWA affirms the obligation of the States  to respect the principle of "do" discrimination  and to integrate measures to combat and eliminate all forms of racism  and xenophobia, guaranteeing full enjoyment of human rights  of all interested people.  We highlight the efforts made by the countries of the region  to promote the socio-economic integration of people  recognized as refugees through programs that provide them  with access to education, health, the labor market  and other basic services.  The GRULAC recognizes the efforts of the UNRWA  to address operational needs and increase the budget  for the region of the Americas.  However, given the current challenges,  the allocation of resources is still insufficient  and is percentage-wise insufficient.  We call for a budget review  that will assess the real dimension of the multiple  and growing needs of the region.  We would like to take this opportunity to support the GRULAC  through exchanges between member countries,  such as the High Commissioner's Dialogue  on International Protection Challenges,  which will be held in December,  and which will focus on the UNRWA's efforts  to promote the development of the region  as a tool for promoting protection, inclusion  and solutions for displaced and homeless people.  It is important to reflect on the lessons learned  from specific context of displacement and homelessness,  to generate recommendations and find new opportunities  to strengthen cooperation for development  throughout the displacement cycle.  We understand that the UNRWA's efforts  to promote the development of the region  will help to support the development of the region  and to promote the development of the region  in the next World Refugee Forum in 2023,  where the topic of development  will serve as the main basis  to move our efforts towards a strategy  that will be complemented by advanced protection,  inclusion and solutions for refugees  and the host communities.  The joint work of the UNRWA  will be to develop a comprehensive strategy  for the development of the region  and to promote the development of the region  in the next World Refugee Forum in 2023.  The joint work of international organizations,  governments and NGOs  will help to achieve the ambitious goals of the UNRWA  through the reinforcement of a sincere,  balanced and effective international cooperation  that will be able to take into account  the concerns of all.  It is imperative to continue to have the unconditional support  of the UNRWA and the United Nations  to strengthen the national capacities  of the region,  the national capacities  that are at a critical point  and to achieve our goals in a more sustainable way.  With the same momentum,  the GRULAG highlights the essential role  that the private sector,  the academy,  civil society  and non-governmental organizations  and profit-making organizations  play against the phenomenon of global displacement.  Despite the challenges,  particularly in the last two years,  we are witnesses of an admirable level of cooperation  within the UNRWA  and the humanitarian system.  We especially thank the donors  who continue to contribute  despite the multiple pressures  that the global crisis is experiencing.  To make the 2030 Agenda  more appropriate,  the challenges we are facing  play against,  especially,  developing countries.  In this sense,  every proposal should be part  of an integral strategy  to obtain lasting solutions  that guarantee a safe advance,  and that will be  the key to achieving  the goals we have set for 2030.  This moment is an opportunity  to intensify our efforts  towards collaborative management,  putting people first.  Thank you very much, President.

 Thank you very much, Mr. President, Mr. High Commissioner, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen.  It is an honour for me to speak today in the name of Switzerland.  After the COVID-19 pandemic and its global repercussions,  it is today that the international community must face new challenges.  War is back in Europe, in Ukraine, with all the words it brings to the populations concerned.  At this very moment, we are receiving new concerns from this conflict,  where civil infrastructure in different cities and even a playground for children in Kiev is being attacked.  Switzerland condemns these attacks with the greatest firm,  these attacks with the greatest power,  these attacks with the greatest firmness.  In such a crisis, the full respect for the rights of refugees and the human rights of the international community  is of crucial importance for the protection of civilians.  We call on all parties concerned to respect and support the actions of humanitarian organizations.  We also demand a major commitment to violence based on gender  and in a positive way.  We demand a better protection of people under the HCR's competence.  Mr. High Commissioner, Switzerland comes here to salute the efforts of the HCR,  its central and ground teams, and its partners in the context of the conflict in Ukraine.  The speed of the reception procedures in many countries has been exemplary  and the efforts of the HCR's members have been well documented.  Switzerland has also contributed by granting the provisional protection status to more than 64,000 people from Ukraine.  On the other hand, it is important, and you have mentioned it, Mr. High Commissioner,  that this extraordinary mobilization cannot weaken the attention and support of other crises.  In particular, in the African Horn, the Sahel, and the Middle East.  It is very important not to forget them and not to leave anyone behind.  Mr. High Commissioner, the World Refugee Forum will be held for the second time here in Geneva in December 2023.  As a co-host, Switzerland will be involved in the process of building a new international community.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Switzerland will be fully involved in this event,  which marks a historic step in the implementation of the World Refugee Pact.  It represents a unique opportunity to generate new multi-party commitments  to achieve a more equitable sharing of responsibilities  and more international solidarity towards refugees.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  forbidden.  Hooray!  Hooray!  We are probably in Pasteur for this fields day,  but what we need to do in RAM AAP  is set up a team of leaders who bring together our governments and countries to make changes  which is committed to providing an effective response to the educational needs of children and young people in urgent and prolonged crisis situations and travel,  restructuring its asylum area to offer more efficient and fast procedures, which allows for faster integration in Switzerland,  maintaining its commitments in terms of reinstallation, with 1,700 people reinstalled out of the 3,200 planned between 2020 and 2023.  To conclude, the Swiss Commission is committed to expressing all its gratitude for your continued leadership at the head of the IHCR.  We are particularly pleased with your re-election until December 2021.  Thank you.  On the basis of the IHCR's commitment to the future of the IHCR, we encourage you to continue with determination the localisation agenda,  to strengthen the subsidiary nature of your organisation through the support of national, local, public and private institutions,  so that they are useful in achieving their tasks in an increasingly autonomous way.  This is not all together that we can do this.  We will do everything we can to ensure that the IHCR's commitment to the IHCR is fully supported by the European Union.  Thank you.

 Thank you Mr. President, Mr. High Commissioner,  Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, Dear Colleagues,  It is particularly pleasant for me to speak at this 73rd session of the Ex-Com  devoted to the problem of refugees, a recurring phenomenon that is growing internationally.  I would like to express my sincere and warm congratulations to the members of the Office  for the good conduct of our debates, as well as to the High Commissioner of the Nations  for Refugees, Mr. Filippo Grandi, for his constant efforts and his personal commitment  in favour of refugees and other displaced and impoverished people.  My delegation subscribes to the statement made by the Chad in the name of the African Group.  Mr. President, this session is held in an international context marked not only by the recurrence  of conflicts around the world, the health crisis linked to the COVID-19 pandemic,  but also by discrimination, persecution,  and the climate emergency and the amplified migration flow.  This situation calls for a real implementation of all the declinations linked to the World Pact  on refugees, whose relevance remains essential to protect and assist refugees,  people displaced from the states and migrants whose rights are threatened.  My country, Gabon, a legendary hospitality land for migrants and refugees,  is at the expense of the price of their protection.  Migrants are socially interested and live in perfect harmony within the Gabonese population  who have been welcoming them for years without any form of discrimination.  All this is not only due to our membership in the various international instruments  for the protection of refugees, but also to the adoption of the 5/98 law of March 5, 1998,  which is the status of the refugees in the Republic of Gabon, which constitutes the first act of inclusion of refugees.  To make it clear, all the activities implemented for the welfare of refugees  are focused on the search for sustainable solutions focused on legal and socio-economic integration.  In this regard, my country has confirmed its interest in respecting the north of the Fulmaux  and reaffirmed its desire to proceed with safe and human migration  by engaging in joint projects, such as the joint program between the United Nations agencies  and the Gabonese government entitled "A approach to human security to strengthen prevention, protection and  and the autonomous migration to Gabon".  This cooperation will improve the international protection of migrants in my country.  On behalf of these commitments, it is pleasant for me to mention here some actions  implemented to the benefit of those interested.  My country is indeed endowed with a biometric passport for refugees  who are subject to international standards recognized in terms of reliability.  It aims at a double goal: to ensure the free circulation of refugees in all security,  and the automation of those who have already been there.  In this same sense, in terms of health, Gabon prohibits any form of discrimination  between refugees and nationals.  In this regard, it grants nationals, immigrants and refugees free access to health care.  In addition, my country provides a health insurance to refugees in order to improve their well-being.  To date, chronic ill refugees benefit from a health insurance under the same terms and conditions as Gabonese.  The process of enrollment is being pursued gradually in favor of other refugees  following a social inquiry that will be launched on the subject.  In addition, we will continue to recognize the need to have an insurance based on a file  developed by the competent services at the end of the classification according to their income  in the best possible period.  Mr. President, economic inclusion was also and above all access to the labour market  and economic opportunities for all, including refugees.  In this regard, partners have been requested, not only with sectoral ministries,  but also with national incubators, in view of progressive and harmonious inclusion  for the benefit of refugee candidates,  to ensure their sustainable subsistence.  Moreover, the integration of refugees also includes the support for the education of their children in school age.  The Constitution of my country guarantees equal access to education and professional training for all.  I would also like to highlight that the free and mandatory character of teaching for all children aged 3 to 16 years old  is what makes my country one of those with the highest rate of schooling.  As for higher education, the transfer of university degrees,  which are made up of the refugee youth's registration fees, is identical to that of the Gabonese.  To conclude my speech, Mr. President, despite the international context fragilized by the multiform crisis,  both on the economic, climatic, security and humanitarian level,  the historic land of asylum in Gabon will continue, alongside the international community,  to provide its support to refugees in the name of solidarity,  and respect for its international commitments.  Our success for all will therefore be measured in the light of our determination to cooperate and to dialogue  at all scales, both local, national, regional and global,  in order to find effective solutions to the challenges that hinder a real consideration of refugee situations.  Thank you for your kind attention.

 Thank you, Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. High Commissioner for Refugees, Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen.  Allow me to salute you on behalf of the Republic of Serbia and wish you all the best for this year's session.  The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is a prominent partner of the government of the Republic of Serbia  in the protection of displaced people.  We are grateful to the HCR and High Commissioner for their work in cooperation with the Republic of Serbia  to overcome the consequences of the conflict in the Balkans in the 1980s and the 1920s,  and to have taken care of the people of the Balkans in the 1980s and the 1920s,  and to have taken care of the people of the Republic of Serbia in the fight for security  in the face of the current conflicts in the world.  It is with great concern that we note the data of the HCR on 27.1 million refugees,  53.2 million displaced and interned people in the world,  and the number of people who have been displaced and interned in the world since the beginning of the pandemic.  We know that this number is wholly拜oressible.  It represents the number of refugees in the world that are with us who face theροphasis  of  Serbia .  Diario  Po consumption Schikken  of the 1990s forced more than half a million Serbs to flee or be expelled from Croatia  and Bosnia and Herzegovina. For decades, our country has invested efforts towards their  reception and provision of care, but also more importantly is creating conditions for  their sustainable return to ancestral homes, an endeavour in which, however, we do not  always experience the understanding and readiness of the inviolated parties and involved parties  for working together and finding a permanent solution.  Internal displacement has been a special problem facing Serbia. In light of the fact that over  200,000 persons were forced to leave their homes in our southern province of Kosovo and  Metohija, seeking safety and security, the government has also imposed a strict ban on  additional pension. With new mental health,  the procedure for relocationomi from ziem separation should again fall into place.  The marched relation between reason and social and graphical inequality remains neutral and  the amendment to EU- heritage three things can certainly be desire consumed over the  migrants brought into development without 已经 expunged.  Providentialism  and750  1.5 million migrants have passed through Serbia, and currently around 6,000 persons staying  in reception centres.  For its part, Serbia is also making a contribution in terms of caring for persons who were forced  to leave their homes in Ukraine due to current events.  In this context, I would like to underline, among other things, the donation of the Serbian  Government in the total amount of 3 million euros for aid to Ukraine, of which 1.2 million  was provided to refugees through UNHCR.  Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take this opportunity to thank UNHCR once again  for the help in implementing the Regional Housing Programme for provision of permanent  accommodation for migrants.  The Commission for the Coordination of the Permanent Refugee Integration of the Government  of Serbia has been a great help to the Serbian Government in the past few years.  I personally saw the successful housing of families in Smederevska Palanka, Varvarin,  Prokuplje, Niš and other cities and towns of Serbia.  I would like to thank the Commission for the co-operation of the Permanent Refugee Integration  of the Government where our marker was found and the reason why we are here, and on the  day of the juridical referendum on the  До shots until January 18 2021.  We believe that some of the measures that the Commission devised to fragile or troubled  citizens has been beneficial to their life and the future of their lives.  In a more immediate future, which will take place in the course of several years, much  More than 20 years, not only that the conditions for sustainable return have not been created,  but also the basic human and civil rights of internally displaced persons are not respected.  It is a devastating fact that less than 2% of IDPs managed to achieve a sustainable return  to their homes in Kosovo and Metohija.  We expect the Action Agenda of the UN General Assembly on internal displacement to create  a framework for a new approach to solving the protracted internal displacement in our country.  In this regard, we support the three interrelated goals of the Action Agenda of finding a durable  solution to internal displacement prevention through averting the outbreak of crises and  providing effective assistance.  Thank you.  I also wish to underline that finding a durable solution to forced displacement is closely  related to the Sustainable Development Goals.  I can proudly say that Serbia is the first country that adapted the principle of "leave  no one behind" from Agenda 2030 to its legislative system by adopting the appropriate legal framework  in September 2020.  Finally, I would like to underline that the advancement in the implementation of the rights  of people in forced displacement puts our responsibility and our development to the principle of humanity  and solidarity to the test.  Allow me to reiterate the availability of the Republic of Serbia to continue its constructive  cooperation with the other Commission.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  I would like to thank you for your attention.  Thank you.  Thank you.

 Mr President, Excellency Ambassador Salim Badoura,  Mr High Commissioner of the United Nations for Refugees, dear Philippe,  Ladies and Gentlemen, Delegation Chiefs, dear friends,  Our presence at this important meeting on the problem of refugees  is the concrete testimony of our undeniable commitment,  a commitment deeply rooted in the tradition of our country,  which has always given a collective and solid response  to the often dramatic fate of all those who are forced to leave their home country  to save their lives at the risk of their lives.  Mr President, the Republic of Congo continually welcomes refugees  and asylum seekers from all over the world,  especially from neighboring countries,  often, unfortunately, facing community conflicts  or simply political instability.  As I speak to you, we have a total of nearly 65,000 refugees  and asylum seekers, divided between 23 nationalities.  But to this figure, we must add  that hundreds of refugees arrived in the last few weeks  in the river city of Ngabe,  all from the Congolese province of Maindombe,  people who were forced to leave their country  and to abandon everything because of violence linked to a conflict  with the ethnicist revolt between the Teke population,  the Yaka population,  and the two, yet, Bantu traditions.  According to the law that sets the right to asylum and the status of refugee,  a law recently voted by the Parliament of my country,  refugees and asylum seekers are judged without exception  by all the rights recognized by the relevant national and supranational texts.  In the number of these rights, we can cite, one by one,  the right to go and come, the right to employment,  the right to housing, the right to education,  the right to health care, the right to protest,  the right to stay in justice, the right to transfer one's possessions,  the right to confess the religion of one's choice,  and this in the same way as national subjects.  In addition, this law also grants protection and asylum  to people who are welcome in the so-called "extra" areas,  i.e. embassies, permanent missions, and consulates.  At the same time, this law widens the field of protection of refugees  by instituting what the legislator called "subsidiar protection".  The Congolese law on the status of refugee, Mr. President,  is therefore a realistic and responsible response  to the pressing problem of the crisis  of the right to asylum.  In any case, this law makes my country a real home  for all the foreign people who have been hit by misfortune  or are in distress and distress.  Mr. President, in my country, the program "Lisungi",  which means "help" in the Lingala language,  initiated by the President of the Republic,  and which was first initiated by the President of the Republic,  has been extended to refugees and asylum seekers  for two years.  Thanks to this program, hundreds of refugee families  have been able to benefit from government funds  and a vast amount of money  during the most difficult COVID period.  This is a great opportunity for us to help the refugees  and the refugees in need of asylum.  Thank you very much.  The government's financial funds are  an entire value of 2.5 billion CFA francs,  that is about 3.8 million American dollars.  This is not a small amount,  and it is much beyond the scope of countries like ours.  Today, unfortunately,  the Republic of Congo, like most countries in Africa  and in the world, is facing a severe economic  and financial crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic  and aggravated by this unprecedented inflation,  which is consequent to the serious events that tear apart Eastern Europe,  this ferocious war between Russia and Ukraine,  with unpredictable consequences.  From then on, we understand why it has become even more difficult for us  to mobilize the financial resources necessary for the optimal management of refugees.  It has indeed become even more difficult to provide a prompt response  and adapt to the situation of humanitarian emergency,  such as this human influx from the Congolese province of Maindombe.  Finally, to finish, Mr. President,  we fully support the declaration of the African group presented by the Republic of Chad.  In my opinion, the Republic of Congo expresses its professionalism  and gratitude to the United Nations  and addresses all its encouragement to the High Commissioner for Refugees,  to the High Commissioner himself, to the various donors,  to the benefactors, as well as to all these humanitarians  who engage daily with devotion and abnegation  for the noble cause of humanism and generosity.  Thank you.

 Excellencies, before I give the U.S. national statement, I rise to condemn today's missile  and rocket attacks by Russia against multiple civilian targets in Ukraine, which killed  at least five civilians, injured 12 more, and destroyed civilian infrastructure.  In the context of our discussions here, it's important to emphasize that targeting civilians  and civilian infrastructure is inconsistent with international humanitarian law.  Now I'll turn to the themes of this session of the Executive Committee.  As we face unprecedented levels of global displacement, my government's commitment  to supporting and protecting refugees and those forcibly displaced has never been stronger.  We must all be more effective, more efficient, and more generous than we are.  Thank you.  The U.S. Commissioned on PTSD is понадirable for a transition  to life-threats and  things that aren't hurting public health progressive relations.  has responded decisively to these new crises, including Russia's illegal, unprovoked invasion  of Ukraine. At the same time, we have maintained robust humanitarian assistance and diplomatic  efforts everywhere else. In the Sahel, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Venezuela, and elsewhere, we are  working with UNHCR and other partners to deliver life-saving aid while also advocating for  durable solutions. Just this year, the United States provided more than $17 billion in humanitarian  assistance globally, continuing our long tradition of humanitarian leadership. The nearly $2.2  billion that we provided to UNHCR this year was our largest ever contribution, a testament  to our enduring and invaluable partnership. I now would like to highlight three U.S. humanitarian  policy priorities. First, we are expanding our refugee resettlement program and encouraging  others to do the same. In fiscal year 2022, the United States doubled our 2021 refugee  resettlement numbers while also welcoming 82,000 Afghans forced to flee the Taliban.  But the United States can't meet refugee resettlement needs alone, so we are exploring  new avenues to expand resettlement capacity around the world.  This year's UEFA World Danielle ition is also FLM's event where alternating signatures provide hope along researchers'  lab searching opportunities for the young and the smelling.  PLUS. As Zephyr and fountain consider reforming the очень-rich military, the U.S. office  two years. Third, we are enhancing protection for particularly vulnerable groups and individuals.  These include people facing food insecurity, women, children, members of the LGBTQI+ community,  those with disabilities, the stateless, and others whose identity or circumstances give  rise to increased protection needs. Mr. Chairperson, our fidelity with the world in responding  to the historic humanitarian need is enduring. Our commitment to those who serve tirelessly  in the global response is unshakable. And our promotion of the solutions that allow  people to live in freedom without fear and with dignity is everlasting.  And now, I would like to thank the members of the Council for their support. Thank you.  Now, as proof of our dedication to elevating refugee voices, I would like to turn the microphone  over for the remainder of my time to one of our delegates, Besma Alawi. Besma, originally  a refugee from Iraq, is now an American citizen. She represents an organization which helps  our nation welcome refugees and immigrants to the United States. Thank you.

 Thank you, Assistant Secretary.  My name is Basma Allawi, and I am here today in my capacity  as one of the eight advisors serving on the United States  Refugee Advisory Board, a new innovative initiative that  harnessed the lived experience and professional expertise  of a diverse group of formerly displaced people.  To measurably engage across global policy-making arenas,  we believe that engaging and recognizing  the power of those with lived experience in displacement  will lead to better and more effective humanitarian  protection program and solutions.  Being a former refugee from Iraq,  it is critically important for me personally  that no other refugee endorse the same challenges  that my family forced over the course of our displacement  journey.  I hope my participation today will  inspire the collective will of this body  to create similar opportunities for meaningful engagement  and partnership for refugee leaders across the world.  And I look forward to working together with all of you,  the global humanitarian community, in the years to come.  Thank you.

 Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you for giving me the opportunity to continue these traditions established by my predecessor, Mr. Antonio Guterres,  to respond regularly throughout the debate to the statements made by the intervening countries.  I will not follow the same order as the interventions, but let me first start with our high country, Switzerland,  to thank them for being our high country. It seems to me the best way to start these responses.  And to thank them also, as I have already announced in my preliminary speech,  to thank them also for having accepted to be a member of the European Union.  Thank you very much.  And I thank the high country for the next Global Forum for Refugees next year.  I also thank Switzerland for continuing to be a host country.  Switzerland has adopted a very similar form of temporary protection to that of the European Union in relation to Ukrainian refugees.  And I thank them for that.  And I also thank you for all the support that Switzerland provides us  in all countries of the world, in all crises of the world.  Switzerland is one of the few countries that has given us additional resources this year.  A year, as I explained earlier, in which our budget had to be increased considerably  to meet the needs of refugees and displaced Ukrainians.  So I take this opportunity to thank you.  Thank you.  I come to the regional groups now, starting with the African group.  It seemed to me, it also seemed symbolic, significant, that the first speaker in this debate  was the representative of the African group.  Unfortunately, Africa remains a theater of many crisis of displacement.  I mentioned several of them during my introductory speech.  But the continent remains, I insist, I often say it,  in which generosity and solidarity towards the refugees are the most remarkable.  So it is important that we listen to a statement of the African group at the beginning of this debate.  I will certainly have the opportunity to...  answer national statements.  Allow me to simply underline that the representative of the Chad who spoke in the name of the African group  mentioned the Malabo summit, the summit to which we participated.  Raouf Mazou, the assistant commissioner for operations, participated.  An important summit that put on the table, presented to the international community  the important challenges faced by Africa  and which need attention.  We need political attention to find solutions and resources to respond to the crisis.  I would like to thank the European Union for its statement.  As I said, for the African group, I will have certainly the opportunity to respond to national,  to statements in national capacity.  Let me here limit myself to expressing our heartfelt support for Africa.  I would like to express my heartfelt support for the EU backing of our operations in so many different ways.  I have already spoken in my introductory statement about the temporary protection regime  which has been established to support Ukrainian refugees.  I want to underline again how important and how an important precedent also  that temporary protection is in terms of...  managing asylum or receiving people in need of protection on the European continent and beyond.  The European Union, as others have mentioned,  it's a very substantive investment to counter food insecurity across the world.  My appeal here is in doing that, all those who are engaged in the fight against hunger  do not forget that displacement is a very important part of the European Union.  It plays a very big role in the crisis of food insecurity.  Or rather, it's a big consequence of food insecurity as well.  More often than not, mixed with conflicts, we are talking about refugees.  So this is very important to keep in mind.  And thanks also for the important mention of mental health, a priority, as I have mentioned earlier,  especially in this very traumatic crisis which we have to face.  Thank you.  And your messages, European Union, on an effective, clear, straightforward global refugee forum  is very, very well understood.  Many thanks go to the ARAC group as well, that spoke through Egypt,  through the interventions of Egypt.  I really appreciate the many expressions of support the ARAC group has formulated  has formulated in respect of all our aspects, all the aspects of our work.  I appeal very much, I want to support very much the appeal of the African group for more  resources from donors, including, if I may add, from donors who are part of the Arab  group.  I think it is very important not to forget that.  And this is very important for the Arab region because we have, unfortunately, in that region,  also many situations of displacement of refugees.  And we note the willingness of states to continue to host for a very long time refugees, but  also the necessity to bring solutions to those longstanding refugee situations.  I thank the Grulac Declaration, made by Panama, I believe, in the name of the African group  and the group of the regional group.  I think it is very important that the region, once again, can speak with a unique voice.  And from that I congratulate myself, from the bottom of my heart.  It is very important to hear a unique voice from this region, which is so important in  our work.  And...  I also take note of the challenges that we must face in the region.  And also, in the declaration that we have heard, the focus on solutions.  I think it is important.  I have said it myself in my introduction speech.  And thank you also for highlighting the solidarity vocation, the solidarity of the African  group.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And I also take note of the fact that the  national security system is very important, especially in the region.  And I think that it is very important that we work with the donor countries to ensure  that there is no region that is marginalized in the allocation of resources.  And we also work in the region, as in other regions, with banks, financial institutions  and development to complement humanitarian aid.  I will now move on to the individual countries.  Let's start with Africa.  Thank you, Gabon.  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. Minister, for your dear friend, for your excellent statement.  We know that Gabon has very good welcoming policies, as well as access, as you explained  well, on inclusion.  And I am glad that you gave a such a practical example, the one of health insurance.  Sometimes we talk about inclusion theoretically, but at the end, inclusion becomes a part  of projects, of extremely practical initiatives, such as health insurance.  Because we know that inclusion is not something that should be simply discussed over student  practices.  as well as the inclusion of refugees in the health insurance,  which are the ones who make the difference in the life of refugees  and make them more easily "inclusive", if I can use this term, in the host communities.  Thank you very much for mentioning the fact that Gabon receives mixed flows.  We often think of these mixed flows of refugees and migrants  as going to countries in Europe or North America,  but it is true that the mixed flows of refugees and migrants  are also moving in other directions today,  and we must consider this when we work there.

 The Republic of Congo, Mr. Minister, thank you also.  You represent a country with asylum practices,  refugee welcome practices,  which are also very important.  We have noticed several times that these practices are excellent.  And from the point of view of the host community,  we are well aware that you live in an unstable region,  and therefore you have to face repeated and constant flows.  But you also have, and in particular through the Lizungui program,  which you have well mentioned,  an example of inclusion policies that we salute  and that we also offer to the attention  of other countries.  And of course we encourage you to continue  in this policy of welcome and inclusion  that has already characterized you for many years.  I will now move to Serbia.  Mr. Minister, thank you.  I will reply in English.  I note you had a bilingual statement.  Allow me to simply say thank you very much.  We took note, I think everybody took note,  of the important points that you raised.  First of all, about the issue of flows  that are affecting your region, the Western Balkans.  You are one of the countries that is most impacted  by the increase of mixed movements of population  through your region, and I think this is something  that we must all take note of.  I also take note of your strong appeal,  to do more to solve the situation  of internally displaced people.  And I fully appreciate that this is particularly significant  in your country.  I took note of the mentions you've made  of the refugee housing program.  I think of course it would be easier,  but we know it's not always possible,  if we could see progress on the political front  to address the root causes of that displacement.  But we will continue to work with you  nevertheless.  And last but not least, I hope I've not forgotten anybody,  my heartfelt thanks to the United States,  to the Assistant Secretary and to BASMA  for their excellent statement.  Thank you very much, Assistant Secretary, dear Julieta.  I think I have already noted in my opening remarks  the extraordinary support that the US has provided to us.  I would say in many different ways,  but in particular through financial support,  you have not let us down ever,  and certainly not this year.  And I'm very grateful for that.  And I know that this commitment continues.  We heard your statement.  Thank you very much.  And also for recommitting, if I may say,  to resettlement in a growing manner  that we are trying to manage together with you.  It's challenging, but so important.  And what BASMA said shows how important it is  to give opportunities to people  who clearly deserve it and more.  So thank you for that,  and we look forward to continuing cooperation.

 Mr. Chair, High Commissioner, Excellencies, distinguished delegates,  We wish to extend our gratitude to the UNHCR, most especially aid workers at the frontlines  of humanitarian work who remain resilient and dedicated in the face of conflicts and  crises.  Our frontliners bring hope and inspiration to the most vulnerable amongst us who live  under the most trying of circumstances: humanitarian crisis, climate change, and armed conflicts.  The growing and continued forced displacement of peoples from all over lead us to the conclusion  that the global humanitarian agenda is, and must be, about people, their well-being, health,  livelihood and basic human dignity.  It is imperative that we must take real action and solid plans, not mere token gestures.  We must take action to ensure a better future for the displaced and most vulnerable, including  women and children, persons with disabilities, older persons and indigenous peoples.  We hear you, High Commissioner, when you made a plea to the international community for  solidarity.  In this light, we, the Filipino people, affirm and confirm our continuing strong and active  support and cooperation.  We must ensure the success of the global humanitarian agenda.  We must ensure the success of the global humanitarian agenda.  Despite our being a modest country, facing serious domestic issues like the energy crisis,  climate change, disaster-induced internal displacement, and a polarized citizenry, we  stand hand-in-hand with the international community in pushing the boundaries of how  much we can help to go beyond our comfort zone.  We assure the High Commissioner of the Philippines' resolve to continue to be one of the organization's  most vocal ally.  We are a nation of migrants, a land of people on the move, a safe haven for nine waves of  refugees fleeing persecution.  Our history is replete with images of our welcoming of refugees from all over the world  under our longstanding open-door policy towards displaced peoples and other persons of concern.  We do so despite the serious challenges facing us and the domestic displacement of our people  resulting from climate change in internal Africa.  We are a nation of migrants, a land of people on the move, a safe haven for nine waves of  refugees fleeing persecution.  Take me though me without thelijk privilege of this call.  I am thankful, however, for your support that it shocked this succ asteroid�� wherever  it may be seven including The Polynesian acquaintance dalamaging agensur merahw intent um  gw stori nak'.  Kelly?  In our aspiration of a better, more emphatic world, each of us should work hand-in-hand  to the best of our individual capacities.  There is an urgency to broaden the base of support beyond traditional donors and traditional  hosting communities.  It is our hope that middle countries can also become formidable, proactive voices and champions  who can fill in gaps where needed and increase contributions where possible.  The so-called "missing middle" must step up and strive to be agents of change.  We must build a coherent, cohesive humanitarian ecosystem that has strong synergies at the  global, regional and national levels, with all stakeholders playing their indispensable  roles.  Mr. Chair, our President affirmed his advocacy of rallying for an international system that  must work for the most vulnerable, especially the marginalized migrants and refugees.  Thank you.  Let me express my gratitude to you, Mr. Chair, for your extraordinary support.  These three meetings were 최대, but dedicated, duties, with an Dee soy doner to meet with  you.  We flavouring this opportunity has spawned the work of a foundation for education based  grants.  In 2020, in three years we will correspond with widows in rural areas, help methods and  education focused on economic support for eachsome.  to the UNHCR and other humanitarian funds.  Our vision is for our country to continue to carve its niche and become an example of  how us in the missing middle can help carry the burden as a member of our community of  nations.  Mr. Chair, we must give a clear direction to the UNHCR on how to integrate climate change  mitigation and adaptation with defined action areas and operational guidelines in the work  of the organization.  There should be sufficient support for developing countries to address climate change displacement  within obligations under the Paris Agreement.  We must also ensure that the global food crisis and rising inflation do not detract from our  ability to deliver humanitarian services nor create more vulnerabilities for displaced  persons.  This requires political will from all parties, including protracted and new crises, and demanding  comprehensive political solutions to end conflict and build enduring peace.  Finally, we must ensure that the UNHCR has the resources and political support to fulfill  its mandate.  Our vision is also for an efficient, fit-for-purpose UNHCR that can respond with agility and efficiency  to any humanitarian crisis in any part of the world.  Mr. Chair.

 Thank you, Mr. President, and my friends, ladies and gentlemen.  May God bless you.  First, I would like to thank our allies and partners,  the international community, for their continuous commitment and support  to the Somali federal government over the years.  I would also like to thank the Samy Convention, the United Nations,  the refugee affairs, and the efforts of the international community  in supporting the federal government in providing protection, assistance, and solutions  to all the affected and displaced population, including the refugees coming to Somalia.  Second, one of the most important priorities of the government in recent months  is to deal with the harsh conditions of drought at a rapid pace,  where Somalia has witnessed the worst drought wave in four decades,  which has led to an increase in global prices of food,  and the country's economic development has been a major factor in the situation.  The government is ready to respond to the urgent needs of the refugees  and provide continuous assistance to the most vulnerable groups in Somalia.  There is a need for a positive response to the continuous drought,  which has led to the removal of more than one million people,  and has affected the way we live.  In August this year, the Somali Prime Minister announced  the re-establishment of the Somali Residents Management Agency.  As of August 31, 2022,  there are more than three million people in a shared anxiety  for the federal government and the Somali parliament.  Among them are those who are close to the situation,  and those who have been displaced for three million refugees,  and those who have been displaced for nearly 136,633 refugees.  In addition, there are close to 650,000 Somali refugees in the region  who are seeking solutions to return to their homes.  The government has been working hard to provide the best possible solution  to the problem of the situation in the region.  The government has also been working hard to provide the best possible solution  to the problem of the situation in the region.  Somalia is one of the countries that has been planning to work  on the "Neruobi" announcement in 2017,  in order to find solutions and to cooperate effectively  with the investigation process to find solutions to refugee issues in the region,  which creates a sustainable and sustainable environment for refugees to return.  The Somali government continues to work for the sake of the international commitment  to the region through the development of its legislative framework,  which is still the project of the Refugee Law  and the Refugee Law in the Somali Parliaments and the Relief Procedure.  In addition, the Somali federal government has supported the development  and implementation of a number of policies and national frameworks  related to permanent solutions,  including the national policy on refugees, refugees and refugees.

| 02:30:22 | 02:32:14 |

 Finally, with the support of the international community,  the Somali federal government is committed to what it is supposed to do.  First, to rely on and to confirm the national and international legal and international laws  after the end of the election period,  and as a main measure of protection, assistance and finding permanent solutions  for refugee and homeless communities.  The Somali federal government is committed to adopting the Somali Refugee Law  by December 31, 2022,  and the Somali refugees are said to have been approved by December 31, 2023.  Second, the implementation of the national strategy for permanent solutions.  The national strategy for permanent solutions is being implemented in March 2021  with the goal of the international agreement on refugees,  as long as it is led by the government and is fully involved  at the ministerial level,  on the basis of the region and the region itself,  and in a comprehensive and sustainable way.  The goals and results of the national strategy for permanent solutions  are in accordance with all the commitments made by the international community  in the framework of the Refugee Council  and the goals related to creating job opportunities,  re-settling, reintegration,  and in addition to that,  part of the federal government's system,  despite the fact that the refugees return to Somalia  are not able to return to their homes,  and that the government is not able to return to their homes,  the national strategy for permanent solutions  is being implemented in the region of Somalia.  This strategy is helping to establish a permanent solution  for the refugio,  and to facilitate the integration of the refugees  and to enhance the recovery capabilities in the places of return.  In conclusion,  I thank the federal government,  the international community,  for its efforts to resolve the problem of peace and stability in Somalia.  Thank you for your attention.  Peace be upon you.

 Thank you, Chair.  High Commissioner.  Greece fully aligns with the EU statement and we will make some remarks in a national  capacity.  Excellencies, distinguished delegates, we need to do more to resolve global inequalities  as well as lack of democracy and respect for human rights in many parts of the world.  Europe can do more to relocate people in need and Greece will participate in such efforts.  We have done so this year in the case of Ukraine.  We've done so last year in the case of Afghanistan, providing almost 1,000 humanitarian visas  to female dignitaries and their families.  We need to do more to provide opportunities for people to prosper and everyone is entitled  to want a better future, providing more visas to people to come and work in Europe but with  rules.  Having said that, the Geneva Convention was not an encompassing tool to resolve all global  injustices.  We see today smugglers taking advantage of people.  Making fortune, transferring migrants, undertaking extreme risk as we see fatalities especially  at sea.  Transferring migrants between countries, safe countries, signatories of the Geneva Convention,  countries members of the Council of Europe.  It is critical to preserve the integrity of the asylum system, providing asylum to those  in need but actively discouraging asylum shopping.  We need to provide shelter to those entitled to international protection in a coordinated  way.  As the EU did in the case of Ukraine, activating the temporary protection mechanism and granting  the right of free movement within the European Union.  Greece has already welcomed 75,000 people from Ukraine.  Some may argue that the European asylum model is broken.  Most arrivals today do not originate directly from countries at risk.  Smuggling networks today get to decide who enters Europe, resulting to asylum backlogs,  lack of reception capacity and more.  The European Union is also taking advantage of the situation in the EU.  We need to provide shelter to those in need but actively discouraging asylum shopping.  We need to provide shelter to those in need but actively discouraging respecting the  Kiev Pandemic Saturday.  first reception countries facing uneven, unfair pressure.  And Greece is committed in protecting our border in line with international law, especially  in cases of instrumentalization of migration, when human suffering yields to geopolitical  strategies.  It's prescient to the face of migrant smuggling, when human suffering yields to financial gain.  We need to get the EU-Turkey 2016 joint statement back on track, and we welcome UNHCR efforts  to increase prevention of unlawful departure, stepping up efforts to combat smuggling networks,  and working efficiently with governments.  Dear delegates, Greece over the last eight years has welcomed over one million refugees.  This year we anticipate 35,000 asylum applications.  Since 2019, we have drastically improved our asylum reception facilities and the protection  of unaccompanied minors.  We now host 18,000 asylum seekers.  We have increased the number of asylum seekers in Greece.  We have increased the number of asylum seekers in new reception centers, fully compliant  with very strict European Union standards.  We are reducing our asylum backlog from 200,000 applications to 30,000 today.  We have placed particular emphasis to the protection of unaccompanied minors.  This is a strategic priority for us.  And we have worked successfully with our EU partners on relocation.  We invest actively on the integration programs.  We have fully expanded our access to health, education, and employment to all recognized  refugees.  We are doing our part.  But as migration constitutes a key challenge during these turbulent times, we need to devise  a collective, efficient management system, serve best practices, create a common European  protection space, but most importantly, stand together on this issue in line with our common  values.  Thank you, Mr. Chair.

 Thank you, Chairperson.  Allow me, first of all, to bring warm greetings  from Malawi, the warm heart of Africa.  I would like to thank the government and people  of Switzerland for the great hospitality  accorded to my delegation.  Let me also thank you, Chairperson,  for the excellent humanitarian operations supported  by your organization worldwide.  Chairperson, the opening statement  of the High Commissioner highlights the main challenges  that the world is facing.  Malawi aligns itself with the statement made by Chad,  representing the African group, and we fully associate  ourselves with the statement made on the plight  of the people of Ukraine.  Chairperson, Malawi has not been spared  from the many challenges affecting refugees,  asylum seekers, and the people of the world.  We have been able to meet with the people of the world  and to discuss the challenges facing asylum seekers,  internally displaced people, and stateless persons  across the globe.  The country has a protracted caseload with a current  population of over 56,000 against a facility that  was designed for the protection of 10,000 refugees  and asylum seekers in Malawi.  Therefore, going notwithstanding, I am pleased  to report that the government of Malawi has maintained,  has maintained the open borders policy and continues  to host refugees and asylum seekers, even amidst so many  challenges, Malawi's challenges are accepted by the limited  resources which is restricting on the provision of the much  needed capacity to manage the different categories of persons  of concerns that Malawi receives through its borders.  You might need to note, Chairperson, that Malawi is  continuing to register all individuals that present  themselves on our borders seeking international protection.  We have, however, noted that there are some that are not  genuinely in need of such protection, and we are taking  measures in order to accord the needed protection to the  intended population and individuals.  As such, we called for a verification exercise to help  ascertain all individuals that require government attention in  the provision of the protection and assistance.  It is our only hope that the verification exercise will  assist our government to know who exactly falls in which  category of persons of concern, asylum seekers and refugees, and  to ensure that the protection of those who are in need of the  protection is provided.  We also have to be channeled to the rightful entities to be  processed and assisted accordingly.  It will also go a long way in making sure that the country is  channeling the right assistance and resources to the population  that is well deserving.  This is very important now when resources are continuing to  dwindle.  Chairperson, you may wish to know that the effects of the  natural phenomenon, like the cyclone Anna and Gombe, have  affected levels of food security sufficiency, and it is unfortunate  to see some partners withdrawing their support.  We therefore join the Chairperson in calling all partners,  international institutions, states, development agencies, and  other partners to partner with us in this endeavor.  Chairperson, you may wish to know that the effects of the  natural phenomenon, like the cyclone Anna and Gombe, have  affected levels of food security sufficiency, and it is unfortunate  to see some partners withdrawing their support.  To ensure that the protection of those who are in need of food  security, and other partners, we invite you to join us in  supporting the work of the National Development Agency and  the National Dining Centre.  Chairperson, the Government of Malawi has made an appeal to  different stakeholders and partners for the provision of  resources towards management and support of refugees and  asylum seekers.  We realize that government cannot provide every support on  its own.  I therefore invite UNHCR and all donor agencies to support the  refugee management and operations in Malawi.  partners who respond with haste as there is a great need to alleviate and meet many of  the required aspects in the management of refugees and asylum seekers.  The involvement of various stakeholders will also help to make sure that we create very  strong synergies in assisting those displaced due to the challenges highlighted here.  Chairperson, our food distribution agency has been having some challenges.  As such, it has resulted to targeting administration of food assistance.  In as much as this is the only way that will assist us to devise a plan for the provision  for the food provision supply support in the persons of concerns.  However,  On our part,  our view is that the change in administering support was done too soon.  The beneficiaries of the assistance are dissatisfied and this is putting pressure on government.  Chairperson, your statement has highlighted the need for solutions.  We believe that effective solutions can only be found if we all cooperate and support each  other.  I therefore,  request you Chairperson and all delegates here present to encourage resettlement and  voluntary repatriation.  On resettlement, allow me, Chairperson, to express my gratitude to the countries that  are in here that usually support and assist in the execution of this durable solution  and on voluntary repatriation.  Our government, our government, our government, our government, our government, our government,  our government, our government, our government, our government, our government, our government,  forilia Weg saw abut the change in workNow  colleague and the policy mediner may therefore raining back want is displace.  As doing so will help to increase the population of individuals who we will be self sustaining in various aspects of their lives.  In relation,  I alreadyolo,  Thank you.  noting that the 1951 UN Convention on the Protection of Refugees  provides that no one is expected to be a refugee for the rest of their life.  Chairperson, I am pleased to announce that Malawi has conducted a study  on statelessness and risks of statelessness,  whose results will be disseminated and validated this month.  As such, we commit to sharing the findings of the study with your office.  And further to that, Chairperson, I would like to share that Malawi is currently taking steps  to review the Refugee Act with an aim to make sure it addresses the very important emerging issues  to help alleviate the challenges that government faces in its management of refugees.  In a special way,  allow me to sincerely thank the UNHCR for the excellent humanitarian operations in Malawi.  The Malawi government remains committed to the management of refugees  together with your office and other partners in the best interest of the people that we all care for.  I thank you for your attention.

 Chairperson, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugee, Mr. Philip Igrandi, Excellencies,  Distinguished Delegates, South Africa aligns itself with the statement delivered by the  distinguished Ambassador of Chad on behalf of the African Group. My delegation expresses  its hearty congratulations to the High Commissioner on the extension of his term of office and  wishing all the best in coordinating global action to deal with refugee crisis. We would  also like to express our appreciation to the Commissioner for the report. South Africa  welcomes the report highlighting global trends on forced displacement, current protection  challenges experienced by displaced persons, as well as the work that remains to be done.  The South African Government extends a weight of appreciation to the Office of the High  Commission.  The High Commissioner and Assistant High Commissioner for Protection for the continued support on  our efforts to eradicate asylum appeals backlog. The high-level visit by the Assistant High  Commissioner, Ms. Gillian Triggs, to South Africa early this year to review bilateral  commitments made in 2015 is an illustrious sign of support and among others we were able  to provide progress report on the backlog project.  Some of the outstanding commitments from the meeting with the Assistant High Commissioner is for the UNHCR Office to facilitate an engagement with Ambassadors and High Commissioners of sending States about the rights and obligations of these States.  The UNHCR Office is also supposed to organize a workshop with the judiciary in South Africa through the Department of Justice on the complexity of international law. We are looking forward.

South Africa is one of the major contributors and remains committed to extend its financial  support to operations of the UNHCR.  Since May 2022, South Africa has received over 20,000 requests to intention to apply  for new asylum, which we believe are part of the backlog that built over the state of  disaster in the advent of COVID-19 pandemic.  And over 5,000 have already been adjudicated at first instance.  Furthermore, over 89,000 requests for extension of asylum and refugee permits have been processed  online and remain valid.  In this regard, the department is looking at additional measures to recover lost time  in this area.  Chairperson, the majority of refugee-hosting countries in the world are low and middle-low  income countries.  In most of these host countries, local communities often experience higher levels of poverty  and face increased chances of economic vulnerability.  In this regard, the economic conditions of the host countries are not necessarily better  than those of those seeking refuge.  The situation is in the case of Africa.  The government is not looking at the situation of Africa.  The government is not looking at the situation of Africa.  The government is not looking at the situation of Africa.  South Africa of today lead to economic competition over scarce resources between the host and  refugee countries and causing increased social tension within society.  Much as hosting refugees is an international obligation, a humanitarian gesture and a moral  statement, it is settled with very deep challenges which cannot be ignored by this forum.  We need to begin discussion on these matters as well.  This includes deliberate, unnecessary human-made contribution.  costs of migration. Linked to this is the burden on host countries by straining public resources  and increasing societal strife and the potential for civil conflict. South Africa believes that  there is an urgent need to lessen liability on refugee hosting countries, especially developing  countries. Therefore, more support to alleviate the burden of hosting refugees is by employing  durable and sustainable solutions in accordance with global combat on refugees, such as addressing  root cause of forced placement, intensification of settlement, and voluntary returns. Recalling the  outcome of the global conduct on refugees and in agrarian global refugee forum on more equitable,  predictable burden and responsibility sharing among states when it comes to refugee protection,  my delegation,  I call upon UNHCR and the international community to provide more support to host countries.  Several countries in the African continent host up to 65 percent of the world's persons of concern,  and 16 countries in southern Africa host nearly 9.7 million of consent, including over 1 million  asylum seekers and refugees. Chairperson, we call upon the UNHCR  to maximize the support of the African community in the field of humanitarian assistance and the  international community. We call upon the UNHCR to increase the support of the African community in the  international community. We call upon the UNHCR to increase the support of the African community in the  another group数 That  countries on a&r答i might meet the international leadership needs, such as Afghanistan and Harris  andanzaniti, thatормa = all nations  Or tweet:  We call upon the UNHCR as worldwide to describe its mandate to provide international protection to  refugees especially in theCKypied terrestries of Western Sahara and Palestine.

 I thank you, Honourable Minister.  Excellencies, dear delegates, I will, for the sake of time, I will close the list of  speakers for this morning to allow for the High Commissioner to give in some remarks  after the few statements we have just heard.  Monsieur le Commissaire, vous avez la parole.

 President  Thank you, Mr. President.  Let me start with Asia.  Thank you very much, my friend, Minister Remoula, for your very good statement.  And thank you again for paying a visit to my office last week.  As I already told you, we are very grateful for the support of the Philippines that you  have explained.  The Philippines is also a nation with much relevant experience to our work, relevant  to our work, internal displacement management, climate change issues, and of course, your  ratification of the 1961 statelessness convention has been one of the highlight of the I Belong  campaign this year.  I  I also want to thank you for your very strong appeal to what you call the missing middle,  meaning maybe countries that are not the biggest donors and are not the biggest host countries  but can nevertheless make a contribution to our debates and to our discussions.  And from the way you explained it, I would call it not the missing middle but the active  middle.  And I hope that others from that group--  I hope that others from that group of nations will follow your very important example.  Let me turn to Europe, to Greece, to the statement by Minister Mittaraki, notice.  Thank you very much, my friend, for your good statement.  You mentioned several very important issues and spoken by a country that has been on the  forefront of receiving refugees for the past few years.  This is very significant.  Your reiteration that asylum must be protected, that also through a better management of migration,  I think finds us completely in agreement, but also the importance of relocation in Europe.  We should not let our guard down.  It's been done for some Ukrainians, but I think it needs to be done for others as well.  And of course, the lessons that we are learning from temporary protection-- temporary protection,  as I said, is not the panacea for every movement, but certainly something from which we can learn  a lot.  I think, and I think you implied that, I don't think we should say that the EU asylum model  is broken, but certainly it's severely in need of fixing and of attention.  And I think that's the point.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  And like I said in my opening remarks, we are reflecting on that, not just for Europe,  but also for other parts of the world.  We heard it earlier from Gabon, which observe, see the mixed movements growing as a pattern  with greater human trafficking, all the points that you have raised.  So I think that asylum, the convention principles are very solid and strong and applicable,  but in ways to do it.  In ways to do it need to be revisited, and we're looking at that.  And we will be consulting with states in Europe and beyond.  I also hear your call that it is important to ensure the security of borders.  This is not only the right, but I would say the duty of every government to do that towards  its own citizens.  But this can be done without prejudice.  This is not a crime.  This is not a crime.  This is a prejudice to access of those in need of protection to protection systems,  without resorting to more drastic measures like walls and pushbacks.  I'm talking now globally here, but I think your statement was very important in this  respect.  And I thank you very much also for your cooperation and friendship.  Let me turn to Africa.  Somalia.  Minister, thank you very much.  Of course, UNHCR has been engaged with and in Somalia and with the Somali people for decades.  Whether they were refugees abroad or displaced inside the country, and this engagement, I  can assure you, will continue.  Your statement relayed, conveyed to this group very big challenges that you are facing: drought,  residual pockets or residual phenomena of conflict.  And I think that's a very important point.  Thank you.  For your support.  And I think next will be you and there and trorst to what the issues in Somalia as a whole  cannot be yet done here in Somalia.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  On the subject of

 of statelessness, but particularly the national solution strategy that you mentioned.  We appreciate that there is a new government in Somalia. I look forward to my visit in a couple of weeks  when we will have the opportunity to discuss more on these matters.  And I conclude these replies with... I know I have two more, sorry.  Malawi, thank you Minister also for your very good statement.  Thank you for starting your statement by saying that Malawi will keep the borders open to those in need.  And I think this is what I said in my first reply.  This is once again the demonstration of the African spirit of generosity and solidarity towards brothers and sisters that are in distress.  And I know, we know that you have not just said it,  but you have done it in a very positive way.  You have done it for many years.  Although the challenges are getting more complicated, climate that you mentioned, mixed flows, you mentioned that indirectly.  I want to assure you that we will continue to stay with Malawi in trying to improve the management of these flows and the search for solutions.  And last again, but not least, thank you South Africa.  Thank you Minister.  Your statement was truly very important and very positive.  We attach a lot of importance to our partnership with South Africa.  Also for historical reasons, of course.  We have been with you across the many significant events that your country has gone through in recent decades.  I am glad to hear from you that the mission by Gillian Triggs,  the Assistant High Commissioner for Protection a few months ago,  we were just commenting to South Africa,  was very fruitful, especially on the backlog, on the issue of the complicated flows of people that you are receiving.  Be assured that the commitments that you have made and that we have made and that you mentioned will be honoured.  And I think I heard very loud and clear your clear appeal on more burden sharing  and more support to host countries.  We have a great opportunity to develop that discourse and that debate that you are inviting us to have  in the context of the preparation of the Global Refugee Forum next year,  where of course the voice of South Africa will be very much needed and very much appreciated.
